# Updated-Portfolio

Your updated site should have the following content:
* Your name
* Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number
* A link to a PDF of your resume
* List of at least 3 projects. For each project make sure you have the following:
* Project title
* Link to the deployed version
* Link to the code on GitHub

Design -
The content of your portfolio page is a lot more important than the aesthetics. That said, there are a couple basic requirements your portfolio page should meet:
* Mobile-friendliness: you don't need advanced responsive styles, but you should ensure that your portfolio page is still readable on different screen sizes
* Readability: make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.
